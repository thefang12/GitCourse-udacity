When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When collaborating with several people. Since it makes it easier to share and review changes 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork makes a clone of a repo within github giving credit to the original author
a clone is just a copy of a local or remote repo
and a branch is a set of commits within a repo to add a feature to a project
I'd fork when I want to create my own version of a project but still give credit to the author
I'd clone when I'm directly contributing to a project
And finally I'd branch when implementing a new feature in any project
